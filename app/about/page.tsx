                            <span className="">FelEsia was introduced to social work before she
                            even knew what it was.</span> While mentoring youth in
                            middle schools, she observed the ways that
                            meaningful, intentional relationships can be the
                            foundation for change. She recognized in these young
                            people her own struggles to integrate racial/ethnic
                            identity, language, economic resources, and cultural
                            expectations into a unique identity. Not to mention
                            she realized she had a knack for connecting with
                            people. Have you ever tried having a conversation
                            with a 7th grader?
