                        FelEsia was introduced to social work before she even
                        knew what it was. While mentoring youth in middle
                        schools, she observed the ways that meaningful,
                        intentional relationships can be the foundation for
                        change. She recognized in these young people her own
                        struggles to integrate racial/ethnic identity, language,
                        economic resources, and cultural expectations into a
                        unique identity. Not to mention she realized she had a
                        knack for connecting with people. Have you ever tried
                        having a conversation with a 7th grader?

                        After graduating with a Master Degree in Social Work,
                        FelEsia has continued to work with folks at various ages
                        and stages of life. In addition to a fulfilling career
                        in the field of forensic social work, she is energized
                        by building durable relationships with individual
                        therapy clients as a private clinician.
                        She identifies as a neurodivergent parent, a Latina, and
                        a first-generation college graduate. She holds a Master
                        of Social Work degree from New York University and a
                        Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from St. Edwardâ€™s
